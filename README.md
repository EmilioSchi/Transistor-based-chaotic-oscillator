# Transistor-based-chaotic-oscillator
About the https://iris.unipa.it/retrieve/handle/10447/276402/535513/81-Minati_Chaos-2017.pdf I show a set of dynamic non linear equation that represent a good approximation of autonomous chaotic oscillator circuit. Chaos is a pervasive occurrence in these kind of circuits.
